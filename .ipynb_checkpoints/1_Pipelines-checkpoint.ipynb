Of course he was unfairly treated by the system and he deserves a good compensation from the Indian govt and people. Thus, his acclaims are well deserved. Yet, the way the movie claimed that India is the first nation to go to Mars in the first attempt and Mr. NAMBI made it happen were blatant exaggeration. It seems Mr. Nambi is a brilliant scientist who kept looking for stealing ideas, data, and resources. He got everything from other countries and the movie made a big fuss about it by claiming he did it from scratch. The way the movie presented ISRO was saddening. There were other good scientists, including APJ Kamal, there as well but the movie kind of showed everyone incompetent. The movie showed big contracts with foreign countries were already negotiated by Mr. NAMBI while in reality these high level contracts could not be signed or negotiated without high level govt involvement. I think the movie overestimated Mr. Nambi and thus fictionalized many part of it.\n",
